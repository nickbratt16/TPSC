# The People's Score Card

##Idea
>A website that keeps track of a current fight's score that the user is watching and then allows the user to score the fight how they see fit. The website will take the score that the user had submitted and then compares it to an average of every other user's score.
##Motivation
> The reason I would make this website is to allow everyone to input their own opinion on the fight to see if my view was biased or if everyone else is in agreeance. I want a platform that will be more streamlined towards the viewers of the product of fighting as opposed to just some professionals with credentials that are sometimes suspect. The point is to make a website that is for the people and scored by the people who watch and enjoy following along on their own.
##Application
>The point of the website is to get people to interact with other people about a fight and in some ways hold the judges scoring the fight accountable for the scores that they submit themselves. It all stems from certain judges not doing their job well and the public then sees the fighters lose with little to no explanation why. So, for me, I feel that it will allow other users to interact and see how everyone else feels the fight went, instead of being confused on how someone lost and/or won a fight.
